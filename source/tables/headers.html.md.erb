Header cells are those that contain the information that is critical to understanding the raw data in a table. For example the number 210 is meaningless on its own, but becomes information if you know that it is the data for a) the number of properties in b) a given street. The `<th>` element needs to be used for header cells so that they are distinguishable from and can be associated with the correct data `<td>` cells.

## Table with header cells in the top row only
{:.ex}

This table of concert dates only needs the cells in the top row marked up as `<th>` cells. This is partly because it is such a small table and partly because the data itself is
distinctly different in each column.

**Concert dates:**

<table>
	<tr>
		<th>Date</th>
		<th>Event</th>
		<th>Venue</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>12 Feb</td>
		<td>Waltz with Strauss</td>
		<td>Main Hall</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>24 Mar</td>
		<td>The Obelisks</td>
		<td>West Wing</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>14 Apr</td>
		<td>The What</td>
		<td>Main Hall</td>
	</tr>
</table>
