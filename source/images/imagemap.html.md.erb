A client-side image map is an image divided into selectable regions defined by `<area>` elements (“hotspots”) that allow user interaction, such as providing links to other pages. In this case, text alternatives are needed on the `<img>` element itself to convey the informative context and on each of the `<area>` elements to convey the link destination or the action that will be initiated if the link is followed.

## An organizational chart with links to individual pages
{:.ex}

The following organizational chart is used to provide links to each Director's home page. The text alternative for the image is “Board of Directors and related staff:”, and each linked `<area>` has a text alternative to identify the individual, such as “Davy Jones: Chairman”.

<%= sample_start %>

![Board of directors and related staff: ](orgchart.png){:usemap="#Map"}

<map name="Map" id="Map">
	<area shape="rect" coords="176,14,323,58" href="../res/beyond" alt="Davy Jones: Chairman">
	<area shape="rect" coords="81,75,226,114" href="../res/beyond" alt="Carole Brewster: Company Secretary">
	<area shape="rect" coords="6,138,155,182" href="../res/beyond" alt="Harry H Brown: Marketing Director">
	<area shape="rect" coords="175,138,323,182" href="../res/beyond" alt="Paula Holbein: Sales Director">
	<area shape="rect" coords="345,136,496,186" href="../res/beyond" alt="Hugh Howard: Finance Director">
</map>

<%= sample_end %>

<%= code_start %>

<img src="orgchart.png"
     alt="Board of directors and related staff: "
     usemap="#Map">
<map id="Map" name="Map">
	<area shape="rect"
	      coords="176,14,323,58"

</map>

**Note:** Image maps may not function correctly on some mobile devices
if the coordinates for the areas are not scaled in the same proportion
as the image. To overcome this you could provide redundant text links on
the same page.
