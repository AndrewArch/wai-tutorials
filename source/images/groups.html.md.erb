A grouped collection of images is sometimes used to convey a single piece of information, for instance star images to denote a product rating. In this case, the text alternative for one of the images should convey the information conveyed by the entire group, all other images should have null (empty) `alt` attributes. For instance, as shown in example 1 below, the descriptive text alternative on one image should be “3.5 out of 5 stars”, rather than “1 star”, “Half star” or “Unfilled star” on each image.

## Group of images for rating
{:.ex}

This group of five images shows a product rating. There are five images, three filled stars, one half filled star and one empty star, indicating the overall rating. The text alternative for the first image is “Rating: 3.5 out of 5 stars”, all other images have a null (empty) `alt` attribute (`alt=""`).

<%= sample_start %>

Rating: ![3.5 out of 5 stars](star-full.png)![](../img/star-full.png)![](../img/star-full.png)![](star-half.png)![](star-empty.png)

<%= sample_end %>

<%= code_start %>

~~~ html
<p>
	Rating:
	<img src="star-full.jpg"  alt="3.5 out of 5 stars">
	<img src="star-full.jpg"  alt="">
	<img src="star-full.jpg"  alt="">
	<img src="star-half.jpg"  alt="">
	<img src="star-empty.jpg" alt="">
</p>
~~~

<%= code_end %>

## Captions for Image Groups
{:.ex}

If a group of images has a caption, a `figure` element can be used to group those images. If those images have a caption, `figure` and `figcaption` elements can be nested as well:

<%= sample_start %>

<figure role="group">
<figcaption>The castle through the ages: 1423, 1756, and 1966 respectively.</figcaption>


<figure role="group">
<img src="../../img/castle-etching.jpg" alt="The castle has one tower, and a tall wall around it.">
<figcaption>Charcoal on  wood. Anonymous, circa 1423.</figcaption>
</figure>
<figure role="group">
<img src="../../img/castle-painting.jpg" alt="The castle now has two towers and two walls.">
<figcaption>Oil-based paint on canvas. Eloisa Faulkner, 1756.</figcaption>
</figure>
<figure role="group">
<img src="../../img/castle-fluro.jpg"
alt="The castle lies in ruins, the original tower all that remains in one piece.">
<figcaption>Film photograph. <span lang="fr">Séraphin Médéric Mieusement</span>, 1936.</figcaption>
</figure>

</figure>

<%= sample_end %>

<%= code_start %>
