Every image needs to have a text alternative â€“ text that provides an equivalent alternative to the image, by describing the information or function represented. The reason for this is [explained below](#why-is-this-important). The following tutorial pages show you how to choose appropriate text alternatives once the purpose of the image has been carefully considered:

-   **[Informative images](informative.html):** Used to graphically illustrate concepts and information, typically pictures and illustrations. The text alternative needs to be at least a short description conveying the essential information presented by the image;

-   **[Decorative images](decorative.html):** Used to add visual interest to the page, rather than to convey information that is important to understanding the text. The text alternative should be null (`alt=""`);

-   **[Functional images](functional.html):** Used alone as a link or button to activate a function - for example, icons for printing and submitting forms. The text alternative needs to describe the
    function rather than the image;

-   **[Images of text](textual.html):** Representations of readable text, sometimes used when special fonts are wanted. This practice is discouraged except for logos, however if used, the text alternative needs to contain the same words as shown in the image;

-   **[Complex images](complex.html) (such as graphs and diagrams):** Where an image conveys data or detailed information. The alternative needs to be a full text equivalent of the data and information represented in the image;

-   **[Groups of images](groups.html):** When a collection of images is used to convey a single piece of information, the text alternative for one item should convey the information conveyed by the entire group;

-   **[Image maps](imagemap.html)**: When one image is used to contain multiple clickable areas, the text alternative for the image as a whole should provide an overall context for the links, while text alternatives for the clickable areas need to describe the purpose or destination of the links.

## Why is this important?

Images are used extensively on websites and can create major barriers
when they are not made accessible. Accessible images are beneficial in
many situations such as for:

-   **People using screen readers:** The text alternative can be read aloud or rendered as Braille;
-   **People using speech input software:** Users can put the focus onto a button or linked image with a single voice command;
-   **People browsing speech-enabled websites:** The text alternative can be read aloud;
-   **Mobile web users:** Images can be turned off, especially for data-roaming;
-   **Search engine optimization:** Images become indexable to search engines.

**Note:** Images are essential for communicating information, illustration, and for decoration. They are critical for many website users, including people who enlarge their screen by zooming and use the images as cues for orientation, and people with some forms of learning disabilities for whom images, such as illustrations, make the text easier to read and understand. Removing images from websites (so called "text-only versions") make websites less accessible for these users.
