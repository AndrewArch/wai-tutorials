These tutorials provide practical guidance, with examples, for creating websites that meet [WCAG 2.0](http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag) (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0). They are useful to people in various roles, including:

* **Web developers** can find guidance and boilerplate solutions for many common development challenges.
* **Web designers** can learn how to design web components that are easy to implement in an accessibe way.
* **Web trainers** can get compelling examples to teach people about accessible web design and development.
* **Content authors** can learn concepts and techniques for preparing their content in an accessible way.
* **Project managers** can gain understanding of accessibility approaches to help with project planning.

The tutorials introduce accessibility topics, including advanced aspects. They are a good starting point for learning and addressing WCAG. To ensure that you meet the WCAG requirements, you will still have to use WCAG resources directly.

Most of the examples are HTML-based, but the underlying principles apply to other formats as well.
